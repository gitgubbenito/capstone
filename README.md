# Introduction
This project is personal, it ocuure to me given my health issues started after getting vacinate (I did 3 dosis) and doctors run many test and were not able to find a root cause for my condition.  
Since  there are available datasets on COVID19 vaccine I wanted to do some research to understand how symtoms correlate with my personal experience. I am going to apply the ML algoritms I learned so far in the curse to analyze the data


The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S. licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) following COVID19 vaccination.
On this project I will use  datasets provide by CDC throug VAERS web site, Datasets are uploaded to github in the "data" folder. Data includes VAERS report since 2019, I will increasily analize each year and if space allows I will combine all datasets

# Dataset
Dataset is compose of 3 large files for each year.  Data description for each dataset file will be located at
