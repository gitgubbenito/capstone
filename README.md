#  Introduction
This project is personal, it ocuure to me that given my health issues started after getting vacinate (I did 3 dosis) since  there are available datasets I wanted to do some research and understand how my symtoms correlate with my personal experince. I am going to apply the ML algoritms I learned so far in the curse. 

The steps I will follow are:



I am going to rely on VAERS datasets

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S. licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS accepts and analyzes reports of adverse events (possible side effects) following vaccination.

On this project I will use  datasets provide by CDC throug VAERS web site, Datasets are uploaded to github in the data folder. Data includes VAERS report since 2019, I will increasily analize each year and if space allows I will combine all datasets

I shosee to use datasets since 2019, for better comparison
